# Welcome :)

## Your last-ever bookmark
Thanks for stopping by. If you're like me, you can't help but bookmark every R-related programming book you find in the hopes that one day you, or someone you know, might find it useful.

Hopefully this is the only bookmark you'll need in future ;).

When I initially released this collection in late August 2020, it contained about 100 books that I'd been collecting over the previous two years. Since then I've found a few more and there have been contributions from many people. The collection now stands at about 150 books. 


Most of these are free. Some are paid but usually quite affordable.
