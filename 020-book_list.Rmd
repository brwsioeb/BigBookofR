## The Elements of Data Analytic Style
[Jeffrey Leek](https://twitter.com/jtleek)

Data analysis is at least as much art as it is science. This book is focused 
on the details of data analysis that sometimes fall through the cracks in 
traditional statistics classes and textbooks. It is based in part on the authors 
blog posts, lecture materials, and tutorials.

## The R Inferno
Patrick Burns

If R's behaviour has ever suprised you, then this book is a guide for many more surprises, written in the style of Dante. It's a concise report on number of common-errors and unexpected behaviours in R. This book would make more sense, if you have been programming and are familiar with such behaviours (not all though), as there is little time spent on explaining why part of behaviour. As mentioned, it's a concise book, 126 books only.

In this book, we aim to provide an easily accessible introduction to R for the collection, study and presentation of different types of political data. Specifically, the book will teach you how to get different types of political data into R and manipulate, analyze and visualize the output. In doing this, we will not only teach you how to get existing data into R, but also how to collect your own data.

## How to be a modern scientist
[Jeffrey Leek](https://twitter.com/jtleek)

A book about how to be a scientist the modern, open-source way. 
The face of academia is changing. It is no longer sufficient to just publish or perish. 
We are now in an era where Twitter, Github, Figshare, and Alt Metrics are regular 
parts of the scientific workflow. Here I give high level advice about which tools 
to use, how to use them, and what to look out for. This book is appropriate for 
scientists at all levels who want to stay on top of the current technological 
developments affecting modern scientific careers.
