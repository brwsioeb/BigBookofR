# BigBookofR
The biggest collection of R books (and maybe later some other resources too)


## Contributing

Please feel free to contribute paid and free books.

For a list of books still to be added, see the [Issues](https://github.com/oscarbaruffa/BigBookofR/issues). 

The collection is quite large, so first check whether its already been included before submitting. 

The format for adding book entries is:

**\#\# [Name of book]**

**[Author] - link to Twitter bio / blog**

**[Brief description of content]**

**Note if its a paid product and approximately how much** 

**(link to book)**


There's no need to render the book - just make the changes to the rmd's :)

Sometimes it's difficult to know in which chapter to place it, but I default to using either the name of the book as a guide, the first bit of how the book describes itself or failing that, what I think it should be. It's okay to add a book to more than one section if you feel it strongly fits both. 


Feel free to add both free and paid books - just note which books are a paid resource.
