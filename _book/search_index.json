If you’re like me, you can’t help but bookmark every R-related programming book you find in the hopes that one day you, or someone you know, might find it useful. I’ve been collecting these for about 2 years now, totaling about 100 books, and thought I’d share it with you :). Hopefully this is the only bookmark you’ll need in future ;). Most of these are free, some are paid (most are very affordable). 1.2 Searching If there’s something specific you’re looking for, use the menu or search using the magnifying glass icon at the top of the screen. 1.3 Contributing Please feel free to contribute paid and free books - see the github. The format for adding book entries is: ## [Name of book] [Author] -link to twitter bio / blog [Brief description of content] Note if its a paid product and approximatley how much (link to book) Sometimes it’s difficult to know in which chapter to place it, but I default to using either the name of the book as a guide, the first bit of how the book describes itself or failing that, what I think it should be. It’s okay to add a book to more than one section if you feel it strongly fits both. 1.4 Contributors If you’ve contributed, add your name and twitter / blog link below! Oscar Baruffa Mohit Sharma Vebash Naidoo Julia Silge Erik Gahner Larsen Nicole Radziwill Nistara Randhawa Antoine Fabri Jon Calder Mike Smith Ben Bolker Maëlle Salmon Laura Ellis Bryan Shalloway Antonio Uzal 1.5 Licence This website/book is free to use, and is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 License. 1.6 About me I’m Oscar.

It’s a concise report on number of common-errors and unexpected behaviours in R. This book would make more sense, if you have been programming and are familiar with such behaviours (not all though), as there is little time spent on explaining why part of behaviour.

Therefore we will spend more time on foundational details than a “crash-course” would. https://dereksonderegger.github.io/570L/ 16.19 Mastering Software Development in R Roger D.

It emphasizes what you need to know to be able to use the language in any context. There is no fancy statistical analysis here. We just present the basics of the R language itself. We do not assume that you have done any computer programming before (but we do assume that you think it is about time you did). Experienced R users obviously need not read this. But the material may be useful if you want to refresh your memory, if you have not used R much, or if you feel confused. https://rspatial.org/intr/index.html "],

But, drawing from a concept in urban planning, there are far fewer resources in the middle. Stretching the metaphor perhaps to its breaking point, new R users at the “detached single-family home” stage can’t get to the advanced “mid-rise” level without going through the middle stage. The “missing middle” in the R neighborhood is the lack of resources to that answer the types of nuts and bolts questions that new R users often have. Things like: How should I organize my file structure when creating a new project? Should I do data cleaning in an RMarkdown file or an R script file? How do I find packages? How do I know if the packages I find are high quality? This book is my attempt to provide answers to these types of questions. https://howiuser.com/ 20.2 Agile Data Science with R Edwin Thoen I joined a Scrum team (frontend, backend, ux designer, product owner, second data scientist) to create a machine learning model that we brought to production using the Agile principles. It was an inspiring experience from which I learned a great deal. My colleagues patiently explained the principles of Agile software development and together we applied them to the data science context.All these experiences culminated in the workflow that we now adhere to at work and I think it is worthwhile to share it. It is heavily based on the principles of Agile software production, hence the title. We have explored which of the concepts from Agile did and did not work for data science and we got hands-on experience in working from these principles in an R project that actually got to production. https://edwinth.github.io/ADSwR/ "],
