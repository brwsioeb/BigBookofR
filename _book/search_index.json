If you’re like me, you can’t help but bookmark every R-related programming book you find in the hopes that one day you, or someone you know, might find it useful. Hopefully this is the only bookmark you’ll need in future ;). When I initially released this collection in late August 2020, it contained about 100 books that I’d been collecting over the previous two years. Since then I’ve found a few more and there have been contributions from many people. The collection now stands at about 150 books. Most of these are free. Some are paid but usually quite affordable. 1.2 Searching If there’s something specific you’re looking for, use the menu or search using the magnifying glass icon at the top of the screen. 1.3 Contributing Please feel free to contribute paid and free books - see the GitHub. 1.4 Contributors If you’ve contributed, add your name and Twitter / blog link below!

I’m guessing that if you’re interested in R then you also like data ;). I initially used Google Analytics for this site but as I’m keen to enhance user privacy I switched to Plausible Analytics from 30 December 2020 onwards. You can view the old Google Analytics summary report PDF here. TLDR 22k unique visitors and 33k sessions between August 2020 and December 2020 :D!! Note that “unique” visits will be higher in Plausible than you’d find with Google Analytics. Because Plausible is GDPR compliant and privacy focussed, each user is identified for only 1 day. If someone visits the site 2 days in a row, that’s counted as 2 “uniques” whereas in Google Analytics it would only be counted as 1 unique visitor because of the presence of persistent cookies and such that allows for tracking of users. From now on, you can view the LIVE site stats right here. 1.7 About me I’m Oscar. Fairly new to R and loving it. If you like this book, feel free to say “Hi!” on Twitter.

R book clubs are usually a group of people who follow along together in working though the same book, with some sort of periodic check-in (often weekly, often via video) discussing the text, exercises and solutions. Below is a list of book clubs. These usually have a specific start and end date, so it may happen that a book club has already ended even though it’s listed here. If you are running a book club, feel free to add it. 3.1 NHS-R community If you’re one of the estimated 10 000 data analysts working in the NHS, here’s a blog post introducing the R book club in what is I assume is their slack channel. 3.2 R4DS Slack Community The R4Ds slack Community has a number of running book clubs. Once you’ve joined the slack group, you can search for channels. They also have a channel specifically for book club facilitators!

Starting with Chapter 9, it gets more technical, and will be harder to follow. But I suggest you keep on going, and do not hesitate to contact me for help if you struggle! Chapter 9 is also where you can start if you are already familiar with R and the {tidyverse}, but not functional programming. If you are familiar with R but not the {tidyverse} (or have no clue what the {tidyverse} is), then you can start with Chapter 4.

Let me make something very, very clear… I did not write this book. This whole story started in the Summer of 2015. I was taking a late night swim on the Bodensee in Konstanz and saw a rusty object sticking out of the water. Upon digging it out, I realized it was an ancient usb-stick with the word YaRrr inscribed on the side. Intrigued, I brought it home and plugged it into my laptop. Inside the stick, I found a single pdf file written entirely in pirate-speak. After watching several pirate movies, I learned enough pirate-speak to begin translating the text to English.

You’ll also see how, by abandoning traditional data structures, you can manipulate structures by building new versions rather than modifying them. You’ll discover how these so-called functional data structures are different from the traditional data structures you might know, but are worth understanding to do serious algorithmic programming in a functional language such as R.

The book also demonstrates that many non-parametric tests, which are needed when certain test assumptions do not hold, can be approximated by linear models using the rank of values. https://steverxd.github.io/Stat_tests/ 20.5 Handbook of Regression Modeling in People Analytics Keith McNulty It is the author’s firm belief that all people analytics professionals should have a strong understanding of regression models and how to implement and interpret them in practice, and the aim with this book is to provide those who need it with help in getting there. http://peopleanalytics-regression-book.org/index.html 20.6 Learning statistics with R: A tutorial for psychology students and other beginners. (Version 0.6.1) Danielle Navarro Learning Statistics with R covers the contents of an introductory statistics class, as typically taught to undergraduate psychology students, focusing on the use of the R statistical software. The book discusses how to get started in R as well as giving an introduction to data manipulation and writing scripts. From a statistical perspective, the book discusses descriptive statistics and graphing ﬁrst, followed by chapters on probability theory, sampling and estimation, and null hypothesis testing. After introducing the theory, the book covers the analysis of contingency tables, t-tests, ANOVAs and regression. Bayesian statistics are covered at the end of the book. The book is free online. https://learningstatisticswithr-bookdown.netlify.app/ 20.7 Mixed Models with R : Getting started with random effects Michael Clark Mixed models are an extremely useful modeling tool for situations in which there is some dependency among observations in the data, where the correlation typically arises from the observations being clustered in some way. https://m-clark.github.io/mixed-models-with-R/ 20.8 An Introduction to Statistical and Data Sciences via R Chester Ismay and Albert Kim An incredibly beginner friendly introduction to both datascience and statistics concepts as well as R.

Reflecting the need for scripting in today’s model-based statistics, the book pushes you to perform step-by-step calculations that are usually automated. This unique computational approach ensures that you understand enough of the details to make reasonable choices and interpretations in your own modeling work. https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/ 20.10 Statistical Rethinking with brms, ggplot2, and the tidyverse A Solomon Kurz This is a love letter I love McElreath’s Statistical Rethinking text. It’s the entry-level textbook for applied researchers I spent years looking for. McElreath’s freely-available lectures on the book are really great, too. However, I prefer using Bürkner’s brms package when doing Bayeian regression in R. It’s just spectacular. I also prefer plotting with Wickham’s ggplot2, and coding with functions and principles from the tidyverse So, this project is an attempt to reexpress the code in McElreath’s textbook. His models are re-fit with brms, the figures are reproduced or reimagined with ggplot2, and the general data wrangling code now predominantly follows the tidyverse style. https://bookdown.org/ajkurz/Statistical_Rethinking_recoded/ 20.11 OpenIntro Statistics David Diez, Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel, Christopher Barr, and OpenIntro.

Stretching the metaphor perhaps to its breaking point, new R users at the “detached single-family home” stage can’t get to the advanced “mid-rise” level without going through the middle stage. The “missing middle” in the R neighborhood is the lack of resources to that answer the types of nuts and bolts questions that new R users often have.
