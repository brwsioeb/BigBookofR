If you’re like me, you can’t help but bookmark every R-related programming book you find in the hopes that one day you, or someone you know, might find it useful. I’ve been collecting these for about 2 years now, totaling about 100 books, and thought I’d share it with you :). Hopefully this is the only bookmark you’ll need in future ;). Most of these are free, some are paid (most are very affordable). 1.2 Searching If there’s something specific you’re looking for, use the menu or search using the magnifying glass icon at the top of the screen. 1.3 Contributing Please feel free to contribute paid and free books - see the github. 1.4 Contributors If you’ve contributed, add your name and twitter / blog link below!
