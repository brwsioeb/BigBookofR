If you’re like me, you can’t help but bookmark every R-related programming book you find in the hopes that one day you, or someone you know, might find it useful. I’ve been collecting these for about 2 years now, totaling about 100 books, and thought I’d share it with you :). Hopefully this is the only bookmark you’ll need in future ;). Most of these are free, some are paid (most are very affordable). 1.2 Searching If there’s something specific you’re looking for, use the menu or search using the magnifying glass icon at the top of the screen. 1.3 Contributing This book could still do with a lot of work, and is hosted on github. The first thing I could use help with is filling out the descriptions of each book. The format is this: ## [Name of book] [Author] -link to twitter bio / blog [Brief description of content] Note if its a paid product (link to book) You can also submit any books not yet included. Sometimes it’s difficult to know in which chapter to place it, but I default to using either the name of the book as a guide, the first bit of how the book describes itself or failing that, what I think it should be. It’s okay to add a book to more than one section if you feel it strongly fits both. 1.4 Contributors If you’ve contributed, add your name and twitter / blog link below! Oscar Baruffa Mohit Sharma Vebash Julia Silge Erik Gahner Larsen Nicole Radziwill Nistara Randhawa 1.5 Licence This website/book is free to use, and is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 License. 1.6 About me I’m Oscar. Fairly new to R and loving it. If you like this book, feel free to say “Hi!” on Twitter. "],
